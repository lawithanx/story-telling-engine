# SEARCH ENGINE OPTIMIZATION (SEO) & DISCOVERY REPORT

**SYSTEM:** STORY ENGINE SE-1347
**DATE:** 22 February 1952
**CLASSIFICATION:** PUBLIC / DECLASSIFIED

## 1. OBJECTIVE
The primary goal of the Story Engine global presence is to maintain "Ancient Artifact" status—optimizing for discovery while preserving the mystery of the recovered hardware.

## 2. SEARCH ENGINE CALIBRATION

### A. META TAG SPECIFICATIONS
- **TITLE:** `STORYENGINE | Ancient Artifact`
- **DESCRIPTION:** "An ancient digital artifact. Origin unknown. This terminal-based relic reconstructs historical narratives from decoupled data streams."
- **KEYWORDS:** Digital Artifact, Story Engine, Tech-JCorp, Narrative Reconstruction, 1950s Computer.

### B. SOCIAL GRAPH (OGP) OPTIMIZATION
The engine is configured with Open Graph metadata to ensure high-fidelity previews on digital relay networks (Social Media).
- **IMAGE:** `assets/img_logo_gear.png` (Used as fallback icon).
- **TYPE:** Web Application.

## 3. CRAWLER STEWARDSHIP (ROBOTS.TXT)
The system employs a specific "Logic Wall" to separate public branding from internal intelligence.
- **ALLOWED:** The root index and declassified documentation.
- **DISALLOWED:** `/scripts/`, `/data/`, and `/assets/`. This ensures that search engine results focus on the **Narrative Experience** rather than the underlying JSON data files or source code.

## 4. PERFORMANCE & ACCESSIBILITY (UX IMMERSION)
SEO algorithms prioritize fast, accessible sites. The Story Engine achieves this through:
- **ZERO-DEPENDENCY LOADING:** Fast Time-to-Interactive (TTI) due to the absence of heavy frameworks (React/Vue/Angular).
- **ASSET OPTIMIZATION:** Use of WEBP and compressed MP4/MP3 assets to minimize bandwidth usage without sacrificing 1950s fidelity.
- **SEMANTIC HTML:** Proper use of `<header>`, `<main>`, and `<section>` tags to provide clear structure to indexing bots.
- **RESPONSIVE DESIGN:** Fluid "Bento-box" layout ensures low bounce rates across PC and Mobile units.

## 5. ANALYTICS & MONITORING
Operators should monitor **Search Console** for anomalies in discovery rankings. Ensure that the "Ancient Artifact" branding remains consistent across all indexed pages to maintain theatrical immersion.
