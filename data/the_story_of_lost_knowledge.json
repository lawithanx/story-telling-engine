    "Joachim Bouvet, a Jesuit polymath, had been selected for a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity: a seat within the private world of the Kangxi Emperor.",
    "Bouvet was one of six 'field agent' mathematicians sent to the East by King Louis XIV of France to teach Western mathematics and spread the influence of his kingdom. However, Bouvet had his own desires: to retrieve a fragment of lost, primordial knowledge.",
    "Joachim Bouvet belonged to a small group of Jesuit scholars known as Figurists. Their central desire was to prove that ancient Chinese culture was not a separate civilization, but a branch of the Ancient Hebrew lineage, specifically searching for 'the divine language.'",
    "At the time, the Kangxi Emperor was solidifying his rule. Having recently defeated the last Ming loyalists in Taiwan and held off Russian advances at the border, he was now turning his attention to science, mapping, and the consolidation of his vast empire.",
    "Obsessed with Western mathematics and astronomy, which he would later use to refine the Imperial Calendar—the ultimate symbol of his divine right to rule—\"master of time and seasons\" he welcomed the mathematicians to live within the palace walls of the Forbidden City.",

    "THE JOURNEY:",
    "They set sail from Brest, France, on March 3, 1685. They traveled by sea, a grueling voyage around the Cape of Good Hope south africa, with a long stay in Siam (modern-day Thailand) before finally sailing north to China.when they arived  Beijing it was  February 7, 1688,  three years of travel.",
    "--------------------------------------------------",
    "Meanwhile, a world away in Hanover, Germany, there was Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. Desperate for word of any findings of lost knowledge from Boivier, he was a mathematician in Europe whose desire was to solve the universal puzzle. He had created a mathematics that seemed to have no purpose at the time—binary. It was complete, yet he sensed it needed some kind of key to unlock its meaning: 0 and 1. Zero representing the infinite, and one the finite. He famously believed that if people ever began to argue, they could resort to this “divine language” and calculate the solution.",
    "By day, Bouvet taught the Emperor the logic of European mathematics; by night, he decoded ancient Chinese texts, searching for the 'lost knowledge' that would finally bridge the gap between Leibniz’s binary dreams and the divine wisdom of the ancient world.",
    "In 1698, Bouvet sent Leibniz the physical evidence he had been searching for: a woodcut of the Xiantian Tu (the 'Prior to Heaven' arrangement). This was a Chinese diagram consisting of 64 hexagrams attributed to the ancient sage Fu Xi.",

    "When the letter arrived in 1701, Leibniz realized that the ancient Chinese 'Alphabet of Thought' and his own binary arithmetic were identical. By assigning 0 to a broken line (Yin) and 1 to a solid line (Yang), he realized the hexagrams were exactly the numbers 0 through 63 in binary.",
    "Leibniz saw the hexagrams as the first 'Alphabet of Thought'.",

    "Physical Binary: The Jacquard Loom (France, 1801)",
    "Joseph Marie Jacquard revolutionized the industry by using physical binary—holes in cards. A hole (1) allowed a thread through; no hole (0) blocked it. This was the first 'Software' encoded into hardware.",

    "What did they see? Well, the broken line representing yin could be represented as 0 and the fixed line yang could be represented as 1. Now the artwork that explained the cosmic life force now had a mathematical representation. Their language of thought.",
    "In Hebrew this word \"life force\" known in ancient China as qi (chi) is known by the ancient Hebrews as \"chi\" חי. Each letter is composed of a numerical value (8 + 10), therefore 18. In the Hebrew number system the value is 18 for life force. The life force represented in the binary is that same essence.",
