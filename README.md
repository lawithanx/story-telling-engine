# STORY ENGINE | Strategic Narrative Computation Unit (Model SE-1347)

**CONFIDENTIAL – TECH-JCORP INTERNAL DOCUMENTATION**

The **STORY ENGINE** is a high-fidelity narrative computational synthesis tool, developed by Tech-JCorp for the tactical reconstruction of decoupled data chronicles. This web-based relic combines cathode-ray tube (CRT) scanline aesthetics, an interactive command-line interface, and dynamically injected JSON narrative clusters to provide a fully immersive, zero-dependency operator experience.

## 🛠️ Operational Infrastructure (Tech Stack)
- **LOGIC KERNEL:** Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+). Optimized for zero-dependency execution in low-memory environments.
- **VISUAL ARRAY:** CSS3 hardware-accelerated filters, linear gradients, and responsive "Bento-box" tactical framing.
- **DATA BRIDGE:** Asynchronous JSON data streams (Fetch API v2.0) for seamless chronicle excavation.
- **MEDIA PROTOCOLS:** Optimized WEBP/MP4 visual encoders and high-fidelity synchronized MP3 audio streams.
- **TYPOGRAPHY:** Custom-embedded 'Prestige Elite' typeface for authentic 1952 field documentary fidelity.

## ⚙️ Core System Functionality
- **TERMINAL EMULATOR:** A fully functional command-line interface for traversing narrative archives and executing classified system commands.
- **NARRATIVE RECONSTRUCTION:** Dynamic logic handles the injection of `STORY.JSON` chronicles, rendered with a real-time hardware typewriter-effect display.
- **TACTILE CONTROLS:** Integrated physical-style knobs and buttons for power scaling, frequency modulation (Mute), and manual navigation.
- **AMBIENT SIMULATION:** Vintage radio attachment with randomly seeded interference patterns and mid-broadcast frequency tuning.
- **ANOMALOUS PHENOMENA:** Internal logic exercises that bridge narrative gaps via operator-input logical verification.
- **MOBILE DEPLOYMENT:** Full responsive calibration with specific UI overrides for radio positioning on hand-held units.

## 📜 Historical Context: The Recovered Artifact
The Story Engine is presented as a **1950s computational artifact** retrieved from a forgotten Tech-JCorp research bunker after the 1948 expedition.

The unit's interface blends tactical military hardware with early experimental computational design. The aesthetic features weathered rust skins, CRT flicker animations, and analog-style transition sequences. Every document within the engine is processed as a declassified or reconstructed data stream, inviting the operator to uncover historical narratives buried within decoupled data clusters.

*OPERATOR NOTICE: Processing capacity is augmented by a Temple Gem recovered from the Jaguar site. Report all paranormal resonances to central command.*
